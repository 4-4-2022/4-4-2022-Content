 * My cupcake class is a template/blueprint for individual cupcakes. I'm specifying
 * the properties of cupcakes (e.g. cost, flavor, bakery associated with the cupcake).
 * 
 * Note that we've made this class a "Java Bean". A Java Bean simply follows a design
 * pattern (is itself a design pattern). A Java Bean includes:
 * 
 * - A Constructor Using Fields
 * - A No-Args Constructor
 * - Getters and Setters
 * - A Hashcode method
 * - An equals method
 * - A toString method
 * - Technically speaking, Java Beans should also implement the Serializable interface.
 * 
 * Note also that we have made Cupcake a Dessert by extending the Dessert class. This means that cupcake inherits properties
 * and methods from Dessert. Keep in mind that a class in Java can only extend one class. This is why we say that Java does not
 * support multiple inheritance.

	 * These are instance variables. They are accessible throughout the entire class.
	 * They don't have to be initialized because they receive default values.
	 * The default values are the simplest possible. Object types are "null" by
	 * default. Primitive data types(boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double).
	 * 
	 * Please pay attention to the access modifiers. They determine how accessible/visible
	 * a member of a class (or even a class itself) is. 
	 * 
	 * Public is the most accessible; a public member is directly accessible 
	 * everywhere in the source code.
	 * 
	 * Protected is very accessible in that it allows for direct access from within
	 * the same package and within subclasses of this type (Cupcake).
	 * 
	 * Default is less accessible in that it only allows for direct access from
	 * within the same package. It is often called "package private". Interestingly
	 * enough, you cannot write "default" this level of access; just don't include
	 * a written modifier.
	 * 
	 * Private is the most restrictive of all modifiers in that it only allows for direct
	 * access to a member from within the class in which that member is declared.
